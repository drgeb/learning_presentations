* Mixing CQRS & ES terms

You will start with Domain (State)
#BEGIN java
type Task = {
   Id: int
   Name: String
   DueDate: Datetime option
   IsComplete: bool
}

type State= {
Tasks: Task list
}
#END

State used as initial before applying events on it

#BEGIN
type State = {
   Tasks: Task list
}
   with
       static member Init = {
           Tasks = []
}
#END

the you will need Commands

#BEGIN
type Command = 
    | AddTask of CmdArgs.AddTask
    | RemoveTask of CmdArgs.RemoveTask
    | ClearAllTasks
    | CompleteTask of CmdArgs.CompleteTask
    | ChangeTaskDueDate of CmdArgs.ChangeTaskDueDate
#END
